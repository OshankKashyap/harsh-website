                You can say that computers are my first love. My father used to bring his company laptop on Saturdays and I used to play with that laptop, that's where I got my interest in computers. I've been playing with devices since I was 8 or 9 years old.

                I want to know every single bit about computers and how they operate. Not computers but all the smart devices that we use today.
